# Frosted Glass

Frosted Glass Effect using html2canvas and Stackblur Canvas.
Improved and simplified version of [this](https://jsfiddle.net/nallenscott/WtQjY/41/) JSFiddle from Nathan Allen

## Implementation

```
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="frosted.full.min.js"></script>
```

Adding the effect to your HTML by simply adding the class frosted-glass:
```
<nav class="frosted-glass">
```

## Issues

Only works with static "screenshots" of the site using html2canvas.
Things like background images don't work with it.

Window resizing doesn't currently work.

## License

Original Licenses of html2canvas and Stackblur Canvas apply.
